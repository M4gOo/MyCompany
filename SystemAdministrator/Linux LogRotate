ready to launch a new application. It is expecting significant traffic/usage of haproxy on app servers after that. 
This will generate massive logs, creating huge log files. To utilise the storage efficiently, need to compress the log files and need to rotate old logs.


install haproxy package

b. Using logrotate configure haproxy logs rotation to monthly and keep only 3 rotated logs.

(If by default log rotation is set, then please update configuration as needed)


yum install haproxy -y

 /etc/logrotate.d/
 
 output from /etc/logrotate.d/haproxy
 /var/log/haproxy.log {

    endscript
